# EmbeddedSystemDesign

## Week 4

### GPIO

Examples include turning ON and OFF LEDs at different timings, as well as making button counters with debouncing.

## Week 5

### Analog Input

Examples include potentiometer with ADC using default arduino library, ADC with On-demand mode, ADC with auto-trigger mode.

## Week 6

### Timer Ports

Examples include generating PWM signals using Fast PWM mode & Phase Correct PWM mode with different timer ports, duty cycles and pre-scaler values.

## Week 7

### Interrupts

Example include applying external interrupts, pin change interrupts and timer interrupts using buttons and LEDs.
