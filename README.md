## Week 4 - GPIO

Examples include turning ON and OFF LEDs at different timings, as well as making button counters with debouncing.

## Week 5 - Analog Input

Examples include potentiometer with ADC using default arduino library, ADC with On-demand mode, ADC with auto-trigger mode.

## Week 6 - Timer Ports

Examples include generating PWM signals using Fast PWM mode & Phase Correct PWM mode with different timer ports, duty cycles and pre-scaler values.

## Week 7 - Interrupts

Example include applying external interrupts, pin change interrupts and timer interrupts using buttons and LEDs.

## Week 8 - Non Volatile Memory

Examples include reading, writing, updating data in EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read-only memory) in Arduino (also using put and get function).

## Week 9 - Power Management

Example include power saving methods like disabling ADCs, Analog Comparators and Sleeping mode with BOD disabled.

## Week 10 - Interfacing with Motors

Examples include using PWM and pulses to control DC motors, servo and stepper motors.

## Week 11 - Communication with other devices

Examples include Serial Communication between Arduino (USART)

## Week 12 - Serial Communication

Examples include Serial communication between Arduino using USART, SPI and I2C communication.

## Week 13 - Interfacing Circuits

Examples include logic level shifting from 3.3V logic level to 5V logic level.

## Week 14 - Design Choices

Difference between microcontrollers (Arduino etc) and microcomputers (Raspberry Pi)
